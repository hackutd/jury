# Physical Judging Setup

Judging with Jury is done in an [**expo style**](https://www.millertanner.com/what-is-an-expo-event/). Think science fair or any expo-style conference that you've gone to. Essentially, all projects will get a table or booth and stay there for the duration of judging. In that time, judges will walk around and view projects by walking to them.

The setup for an expo style event generally includes booths (most likely just tables or classrooms) where each team will be assigned a table to stand at. Here's an example of a map of tables at an event:

Jury will automatically assign projects to a table number, so you just need to make sure to have as many tables as projects. If you don't have enough tables, you can simply add more tables as you add projects.
